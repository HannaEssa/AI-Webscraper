Detailed Explanation of Key Sections:
    Web Scraping:

        Selenium: Used for web scraping, particularly for dynamic websites that require JavaScript rendering. By
        controlling a headless browser (a browser that runs without a UI), you can retrieve the fully rendered HTML
        content.

        Remote WebDriver: The script connects to a remote WebDriver instance, which allows you to control a browser
        running on a server or cloud platform. This is especially useful when scraping from a location that is blocked
        or requires a proxy.

        Screenshot: This is useful for debugging purposes, allowing you to visually capture the page being scraped.

    Content Extraction:

        BeautifulSoup: A library that makes it easy to parse and manipulate HTML. It is used here to extract the <body>
        tag and clean up the content by removing unnecessary tags like <script> and <style>.
